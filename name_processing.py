''' Using a dataset of 1667 names common in Britain in the 1980s, Cutler et
al. found that female names are longer, more likely to end in a vowel or sonorant consonant, less
likely to have initial primary stress, and more likely to contain the vowel [i]. We test whether a
subset of these results extend to names popular in the United States, and we expect the outcomes
of the current study to align with Cutler et al.â€™s (1990) findings. '''
